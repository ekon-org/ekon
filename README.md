# EKON - Ek Object Notation

[ekon.github.io - COMING SOON!](https://ekon.github.io)

EKON is a sane alternative for JSON that is geared towards readability and compressibility. It can be used to write both data-based files and config files.
***Ek*** (pronounced 'A(e)k') is a Sanskrit derived word which when translated to English means **one (1)**. EKON represents that philosophy. **Ek (one)** markup language for all uses.

## Features

- **Readability:** is kept in mind when designing EKON. So, EKON might feel similar to YAML but without constraining users to tab-based spacing
- **Compressibility** is a major factor that contributed to JSON being the most popular mode of communication among libraries and frameworks. EKON code is roughly ~40% smaller than JSON while maintaining high readibility.
- **Backwards Compatibility with JSON** is a factor that is kept in mind while designing EKON. Rename your `.json` file to `.ekon` and unlock a lot of possibilities.
- **A very fast parser for EKON** is provided thanks to [zzzJSON](https://github.com/dacez/zzzJSON) written in C.
- **Full compatibility with all programming languages** made easy by writing the library in C. WASM support boosts the cause further.
- **Schema support** using `*.d.ek` (EkScript definition) or `*.d.ts` (TypeScript definition files) files. [More on this](#schema-support)
- **Optional Commas** not only saves you keystrokes and filesize, but also improves readibility
- **Optional Root Object Curly Braces** also helps improve readibility

## Syntax & Specification:

Remember EKON is fully compatible with JSON and [JSON5](https://json5.org). Here is the whole specification of EKON at one glance from [specs.ekon](./specs.ekon).

```javascript
/// specs.d.ek // or specs.d.ts // definition file for the current EKON file.
// { // If the global (root) structure is an object/map, you can ignore writing '{' (optional)

// single line comments only
// you can skip writing the commas (optional)

// null
nullValue: null

// strings
doubleQuotes: "You can use 'single-quotes' inside"
singleQuotes: 'You can use "double-quotes" inside'
multilineStrings: `
This is
a multiline
string
`

// numbers
intNumber: 123
floatingPointNumber: -0.12345
leadingDecimalPointNumber: .12345
trailingDecimlPointNumber: 12345.
positiveSignNumber: +12345.123
hexadecimalNumber: 0xdecaf

// Arrays
arrays: [
    "hello there"
    123
    { key: "value" }, // commas are optional
    [ "another array" ]
]

// key-value maps/objects
objectMap: {
    world: 'No comma rules still apply inside'
    arr: [
        "Hello"
        "World"
    ],
    anotherNumber: 123,   // trailiing commas
}

// JSON backwards compatibility
"hello": {
    "array": [
        "hello"
    ],
    "numberVal": 123
},
"key": 123,
"jsonObject": {
    "key": "value"
}

// Compressed form
stringVal:'h'arrayVal:[1,2,3,4]numVal:1.1 obj:{k: 'v'}multiline:"hi\nthere\n"

// } - // As said before. If root structure is an object/map, `{}` is optional.

// Root Array must require `[]` though
```


## Schema Support

EKON supports schema based on a `.d.ek` (EkScript) or `.d.ts` (TypeScript) definition files. Simply write the type
of the `.ekon` file as `type ekonSpecs = ..` in the global namespace. The type name should start with `ekon` followed by the name of the file.

The `.d.ek` or `.d.ts` follow the TypeScript type definition specification.

For manual type declaration location, add `/// file: specs.d.ek | ekonSpecs` on the first line of the `.ekon` file.

If you want to have the type declaration in the `.ekon` file, declare the definition under triple slash comments (`///`) until your declaration
is not complete. Specification for this is the TypeScript type specs:

If the root object 
```typescript
/// {
/// key: string,
/// ...
/// }
```
or

if the root object/map is an array:
```typescript
/// [string, { key: number }, string[] ]
```

Example:

```typescript
// specs.d.ek

type ekonSpecs = {
    unquotedKey: string,
    singleQuotes: string,
    multilineStrings: string,
    intNumber: number,
    floatingPointNumber: number,
    leadingDecimalPointNumber: number,
    trailingDecimlPointNumber: number,
    positiveSignNumber: number,
    hexadecimalNumber: number,
    arrays: [ string, number, { key: string }, string[]],
    objectMap: { world: string, arr: string[], anotherNumber: number }
    hello: { array: string, "number": number },
    key: number,
    jsonObject: { key: string }   
}
```
