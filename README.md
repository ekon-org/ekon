# EKON - Ek Object Notation

[ekon.github.io - COMING SOON!](https://ekon.github.io)

EKON is a sane alternative for JSON that is geared towards readability and compressibility. It can be used to write both data-based files and config files.
***Ek*** (pronounced 'A(e)k') is a Sanskrit derived word which when translated to English means **one (1)**. EKON represents that philosophy. **Ek (one)** markup language for all uses.

## Features

- **Readability:** is kept in mind when designing EKON. So, EKON might feel similar to YAML but without constraining users to tab-based spacing
- **Compressibility** is a major factor that contributed to JSON being the most popular mode of communication among libraries and frameworks. EKON code is roughly ~40% smaller than JSON while maintaining high readibility.
- **Backwards Compatibility with JSON** is a factor that is kept in mind while designing EKON. Rename your `.json` file to `.ekon` and unlock a lot of possibilities.
- **A very fast parser for EKON** is provided thanks to [zzzJSON](https://github.com/dacez/zzzJSON) written in C.
- **Full compatibility with all programming languages** made easy by writing the library in C. WASM support boosts the cause further.
- **Schema support** using `*.d.ek` (EkScript definition) or `*.d.ts` (TypeScript definition files) files. [More on this](#schema-support)
- **Optional Commas** not only saves you keystrokes and filesize, but also improves readibility
- **Optional Root Object Curly Braces** also helps improve readibility

## Syntax & Specification:

EKON is fully compatible with [JSON](https://json.org) and [JSON5](https://json5.org). Here is the whole specification of EKON at one glance from [specs.ekon](./specs.ekon).

```javascript
/// specs.d.ek // or specs.d.ts // definition file for the current EKON file.
// { // If the global (root) structure is an object/map, ignore '{' (optional)

// single line comments only
// keyValues can be without quotes

// -- NULL
nullValue: null  // Yeah! commas are finally optional

// -- STRINGS

// Unquoted Strings are simple one word strings & have a few conditions:
//  1. No WhiteSpace characters
//  2. characters:
//      - ':', '{', '}', '[', ']', "'", '"', ',' will be parsed as end of strings
//      - If you wish to use the above in strings, use quoted strings instead.
//          Escape characters will not be supported in strings
//  3. "//" WON'T be parsed as string. It will be parsed as a part of comments
//  4. Reserved words: 'true', 'false', 'null' will be parsed as string
//  5. If its a number, it will be parsed as a number & not as string 
unquotedKey: forSimpleOneWordStrings
unquotedKey2: john_doe@gmail.com // TIP: URLS with ':' has to be under single quotes

// for full support of the above characters, use the following three forms
doubleQuotes: "You can use 'single-quotes' inside" // prefer single-quotes though
singleQuotes: 'You can use "double-quotes" inside'
multilineUseSingleQuotesAsWell: '
This is
a multiline
string
'
'single QuotedKey': 'Prefer single-quotes over double-quotes for keys'
'multiline
keys are
supported': github.com/Himujjal/ekon

// -- NUMBERS
intNumber: 123
floatingPointNumber: -0.12345
positiveSignNumber: +12345.123
hexadecimalNumber: 0xdecaf
leadingDecimalPoint: .123 // == 0.123
trailingDecimalPoint: 123. // == 123.0
binaryNumber: 0b110011
underscoreIntegers: 123_456
underscoreInOctalAndBinaryToo: 0b1001_1001_0000
Decimal: -.123

// -- ARRAYS
arrays: [
    "hello there"
    123
    { key: "value" }, // commas are optional
    [ "another array" ]
]

// -- KEY-VALUE MAPS (A.K.A.: OBJECTS)
objectMap: {
    world: 'No comma rules still apply inside'
    arr: [
        "Hello"
        "World"
    ],
    nestedObj: {
        inNestedObj: CurlyBracesCompulsory
    }
    anotherNumber: 123,   // trailiing commas
}

// -- JSON backwards compatibility
"hello": {
    "array": [
        "hello"
    ],
    "numberVal": 123
},
"key": 123,
"jsonObject": {
    "key": "value"
}

// -- Compressed form - yeah! unlike YAML, whitespace is insignificant in EKON files
stringVal:h arrayVal:[1,2,3,4]numVal:-.1 obj:{k:v}multiline:"hi\nthere\n"
// -- Comparison with compressed JSON
"stringVal":"h","arrayVal":[1,2,3,4],"numVal":-0.1,"obj":{"k":"v"},"multiline":"hi\nthere\n"

// } - // As said before. If root structure is an object/map, `{}` is optional.

// Root Array must require `[]` though
```

## Style Guide:

Try to adher to these rules while writing proper `EKON` based configs:
These don't matter for minified form. `Formatter` & `Minifier` APIs
will soon be available (TODO!).

1. Prefer unquoted strings as key
2. Prefer unquoted strings as values whenever possible
3. Use single quotes over double quotes whenever possible for values & keys
4. Try your best to avoid commas, looks clean
5. Use 80 as the maximum line length. For under 80 chars lines:
    a. Arrays should be put into single line for under 80 chars lines 
    b. Objects should have put into single line "with commas" for under 80 chars lines
6. For nested data structures, prefer prepending at least 2 whitespace. No rule beyond that.
    EKON is anyways whitespace agnostic.
7. Prefer `0` for decimal based numbers whenever possible 


## Schema Support

EKON supports schema based on a `.d.ek` (EkScript) or `.d.ts` (TypeScript) definition files. Simply write the type
of the `.ekon` file as `type ekonSpecs = ..` in the global namespace. The type name should start with `ekon` followed by the name of the file.

The `.d.ek` or `.d.ts` follow the TypeScript type definition specification.

For manual type declaration location, add `/// file: specs.d.ek | ekonSpecs` on the first line of the `.ekon` file.

If you want to have the type declaration in the `.ekon` file, declare the definition under triple slash comments (`///`) until your declaration
is not complete. Specification for this is the TypeScript type specs:

If the root object 
```typescript
/// root = {
/// key: string,
/// ...
/// }
```
or

if the root object/map is an array:
```typescript
/// [string, { key: number }, string[] ]
```

Example:

```typescript
// specs.d.ek or specs.d.ts

type root = {
    unquotedKey: string,
    singleQuotes: string,
    multilineStrings: string,
    intNumber: number,
    floatingPointNumber: number,
    leadingDecimalPointNumber: number,
    trailingDecimlPointNumber: number,
    positiveSignNumber: number,
    hexadecimalNumber: number,
    arrays: [ string, number, { key: string }, string[]],
    objectMap: { world: string, arr: string[], anotherNumber: number }
    hello: { array: string, "number": number },
    key: number,
    jsonObject: { key: string }   
}
```
