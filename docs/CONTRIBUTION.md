# Contribution

Any open source project always expects good contributions from the community.
Ekon needs a lot of improvements of a variety of fields

Here's how you can contribute to the project:

1. **Specification:*** Although EKON specification is 95% done, there is still a
                        chance of improvement.
                        To suggest something new, head on to
                        [Discussion Ideas](https://github.com/ekon-org/ekon/discussions/categories/ideas) 
                        and suggest your ideas
2. **C API:** The C-API is meant to be super performant and accurate as many other high
                languages depend on it. If you feel somehow some bug is there,
                memory is leaking or somewhere its very slow, feel free to report
                it immediately or make a pull request. The code is available at
                [ekon.c](../ekon.c) & [ekon.h](../ekon.h)
3. **Nim API & CLI:** Nim API and Nim CLI is meant to be a start to writing EKON.
                    Feel free to make improvement. The code is available at
                    [nimekon](../src/utils/nimekon)
4. **Other languages**: EKON bindings might be available for other languages
                        and frameworks. You might consider contributing to them
                        as well. Or build a repo and submit an issue regarding 
                        the new language binding.
5. **Other contribution:** Documentation, [Official Website](#official-website),
                            CI/CD if somewhere you feel the need, do contribute

For every contribution above except (1) make a github issue.
